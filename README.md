Writing a comprehensive RFP can be challenging, even for seasoned teams. The process can become even more difficult if your organization needs a new or updated Drupal site to meet your complex, specific needs. To help you craft your Drupal RFP (and get highest-quality responses), be sure to include the following items: 

An introduction that provides background on your company and your project 
The goals of your project 
As much detail as possible on project-specific features and functionality, including: 
Content types or entities that will power the information on your site 
eCommerce needs and processes 
Integrations with CRM or ERP systems, email marketing platforms, payment gateways, chat widgets, etc. 
Clear direction of where content will come from, especially if you’re building a new site (in many cases, content cannot be transferred over 1:1 due to structural changes to the site and landing pages) 
Your plan for hosting (or provide details if you’d like your vendor to provide hosting services) 
Any partnership preferences, such as years of experience, number of employees, use of contractors, lor location 
The scope of the partnership, including any ongoing maintenance and support you may need  
Your ideal budget, which allows bidders to know if their pricing is within your range 
Your preferred timeline for completion, including factors that are driving your deadlines
