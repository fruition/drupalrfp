# Drupal RFP Repo
We created this guide to simplify the RFP writing process for Federal, State and Local Municiplaities that require mission critical Drupal 8 and 9 support services. This repo is the framework for the calcuator and RFP wizard to pull in relevant language to your RFP without having to rewrite large chunks.

For government and nonprofit organizations, crafting the perfect Drupal Request For Proposal (RFP) ensures you find the perfect digital development agency to meet your institution’s needs. A well-written RFP communicates your need for services, explains the project scope and goals, and sets expectations for new partnerships. Read on to learn more about RFPs, the drafting process, and why a well-written RFP can streamline your next project. 

## When To Issue An RFP 
RFPs are often used by government, municipality, or non profit organizations when an upcoming project can’t be completed in-house. Creating an RFP for a Drupal project can give your team the technical expertise and skill to add additional functionality, efficiency, and integrations to your site. Building or updating a Drupal site can be complex and highly specialized, so issuing a detailed RFP can help your organization identify the right team for your needs. 

## Drafting Your RFP 
Before issuing your RFP to vendors, you and your team will need to carefully consider your needs. For best results, your organization should follow these steps: 

*Identify project leads and stakeholders: Gathering key stakeholders and identifying project leaders will guide the RFP drafting process and the project itself. As such, this team should have organizational experience and project-specific knowledge. Be sure to include stakeholders from every relevant department so you get a comprehensive understanding of your project’s impact.  

*Establish a budget and timeline: Establishing your budget at the beginning of your project can guide your decision-making as you decide what components of your end product are essential. 

*Determine project non-negotiables: After your budget is finalized, determine which parts of the project are non-negotiable and which are “nice to have” items. 
Create a timeline: Sharing your ideal timeline can help agencies know if your project is a good fit. If a business objective or event is driving the timeline, be sure to include those details in your RFP. Don’t forget to note the proposal deadline, the evaluation window, the selection date window, and the final project completion date. 

*Draft your RFP: Once you’ve gathered all the relevant information, draft your RFP. Make sure all key stakeholders have the chance to review and provide feedback.
Issue your RFP: If all stakeholders sign off on the draft, it’s time to issue your RFP and start gathering, reviewing, and evaluating responses. 

## Why A Well-Drafted RFP Is Crucial To Your Project’s Success 
As seen above, much preparation and planning should go into drafting your RFP. While this may seem time consuming, a well-crafted RFP benefits your organization in many ways: 

*Make the decision-making process easier: By explaining the features, functionality, and use cases of your Drupal site in depth, you’ll receive more comprehensive proposals that will make it easier for you to tell which company can best meet your needs 

*Narrow down options sooner: The RFP process can be lengthy and time consuming, especially if you have a small team. By making your RFP as specific as possible, you’ll narrow down the amount of companies who can truly meet your needs. This will save your team time, since they won’t spend time reviewing applications from agencies that aren’t a good fit. 

*Save time: A well-written RFP should answer most questions that respondents may have. By anticipating questions and answering them within the RFP itself, you’ll spend less time answering follow-up questions, which allows your team to spend more time completing their normal duties or reviewing responses.
